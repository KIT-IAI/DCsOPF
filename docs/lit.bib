Math. 60(4), 897â€“936, 1938) was revealed to be a cheap alternative to Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper we apply Polynomial Chaos to stationary and transient problems, both from academics and from industry. For each of the applications, chances and limits of Polynomial Chaos are discussed. The presented problems show the need for new theoretical results.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past half-century, Optimal Power Flow (OPF) has become one of the most important and widely studied nonlinear optimization problems. In general, OPF seeks to optimize the operation of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution networks subject to system constraints and control limits. Within this framework, however, there is an extremely wide variety of OPF formulations and solution methods. Moreover, the nature of OPF continues to evolve due to modern electricity markets and renewable resource integration. In this two-part survey, we survey both the classical and recent OPF literature in order to provide a sound context for the state of the art in OPF formulation and solution methods. The survey contributes a comprehensive discussion of specific optimization techniques that have been applied to OPF, with an emphasis on the advantages, disadvantages, and computational characteristics of each. PartÂ I of the survey (this article) provides an introduction and surveys the deterministic optimization methods that have been applied to OPF. PartÂ II of the survey examines the recent trend towards stochastic, or non-deterministic, search techniques and hybrid methods for OPF.},

  Abstract                 = {The ways in which engineering systems fail (i.e., their occurence and frequency) demonstrate considerable differences between hypothetical models assumed for design and actual performance. All materials contain imperfections. All systems are subject to complex interrelationships, material defects, structural deficiencies, human errors, ambient fluctuations, and, hence, to varying degrees of randomness (uncertainties). Various methods have been offered to accomodate uncertainty. The most common, by far, is to assign single-valued point estimates that reflect central tendencies or implied levels of conservatism. Analyses are then reduced to deterministic treatments. More direct probabilistic methods employ Monte Carlo simulations or truncated Taylor series. However, analyses rapidly become exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for these methods for all but a very few uncorrelated random variables. These matters and others have been ameliorated by Rosenblueth's point estimate method.1 Many problems are encountered that require numerous correlated random variables. For such systems all of the above methods become untractable. This paper presents a simple procedure that accomodates the analyses of such systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A new and efficient point estimate method is developed to calculate the statistical moments of a random quantity, Z, that is a function of n random variables, X. The method is an extension of Rosenblueth's two-point concentration method. The method uses m Ã— n concentrations matching up to the first m Ã— n non-crossed moments of each random variable and crossed second order moments of the random variables. The kth moment of Z is calculated by weighting the value of Z to the power of k evaluated at n Ã— m locations. Simple to use formulas are provided for two special cases of the method, i.e. 2n-concentration scheme and 2n + 1-concentration scheme. This 2n-concentration scheme considers the skewness of probability density function. The 2n + 1-concentration scheme considers the skewness and kurtosis of probabilility density function. The correlations between the random variables are considered by using a rotational transformation based on the eigenvector of covariance matrix. Illustrative examples are presented. },

  Abstract                 = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

  Abstract                 = {{We present an efficient numerical strategy for the Bayesian solution of inverse problems. Stochastic collocation methods, based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), are used to construct a polynomial approximation of the forward solution over the support of the prior distribution. This approximation then defines a surrogate posterior probability density that can be evaluated repeatedly at minimal computational cost. The ability to simulate a large number of samples from the posterior distribution results in very accurate estimates of the inverse solution and its associated uncertainty. Combined with high accuracy of the gPC-based forward solver, the new algorithm can provide great efficiency in practical applications. A rigorous error analysis of the algorithm is conducted, where we establish convergence of the approximate posterior to the true posterior and obtain an estimate of the convergence rate. It is proved that fast (exponential) convergence of the gPC forward solution yields similarly fast (exponential) convergence of the posterior. The numerical strategy and the predicted convergence rates are then demonstrated on nonlinear inverse problems of varying smoothness and dimension.}},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides an overview of computationally efficient approaches for quantifying the influence of parameter uncertainties on the states and outputs of nonlinear dynamical systems with finite-time control trajectories, focusing primarily on computing probability distributions. The advantages and disadvantages of various uncertainty analysis approaches, which use approximate representations of the full nonlinear model using power series or polynomial chaos expansions, are discussed in terms of computational cost and accuracy in computing the shape and tails of the state and output distributions. Application of the uncertainty analysis methods to a simulation study is used to provide advice as to which uncertainty analysis methods to select for a particular application. In particular, the results indicate that first-order series analysis can be accurate enough for the design of real-time robust feedback controllers for batch processes, although it is cautioned that the accuracy of such analysis should be confirmed a posteriori using a more accurate uncertainty analysis method. The polynomial chaos expansion is well suited to robust design and control when the objectives are strongly dependent on the shape or tails of the distributions of product quality or economic objectives. },

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic simulation of stochastic systems requires uncertainty propagation. Traditional sample-based uncertainty propagation methods are often computationally intractable for online optimization-based estimation and control applications. Generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) is an efficient uncertainty propagation method that has been used for solving various nonlinear estimation and optimal control problems. However, gPC requires knowledge of the exact probability distribution of the random variables, and does not explicitly account for correlations between these random variables. This paper demonstrates the use of arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) for propagation of correlated multivariate random variables. aPC constructs orthogonal polynomial basis functions from only the raw moments of the random variables. Thus, aPC can be used for propagation of uncertainties with arbitrary probability distributions, even if their functional forms are unknown. The main contributions of this paper consist of presenting an algorithm for generating a set of orthogonal polynomial basis functions for correlated multivariate random variables and applying the Galerkin projection to compute closed-form expressions for the dynamics of the aPC expansion coefficients. An algorithm is also presented for efficient calculation of inner products between polynomial basis functions needed in the Galerkin projection. The error convergence properties of aPC are investigated and compared to that of gPC and Monte Carlo using a dynamic simulation case study.},

  Abstract                 = { We provide an optimization framework for computing optimal upper and lower bounds on functional expectations of distributions with special properties, given moment constraints. Bertsimas and Popescu (Optimal inequalities in probability theory: a convex optimization approach. SIAM J. Optim. 2004. Forthcoming) have already shown how to obtain optimal moment inequalities for arbitrary distributions via semidefinite programming. These bounds are not sharp if the underlying distributions possess additional structural properties, including symmetry, unimodality, convexity, or smoothness. For convex distribution classes that are in some sense generated by an appropriate parametric family, we use conic duality to show how optimal moment bounds can be efficiently computed as semidefinite programs. In particular, we obtain generalizations of Chebyshevâ€™s inequality for symmetric and unimodal distributions and provide numerical calculations to compare these bounds, given higher-order moments. We also extend these results for multivariate distributions. },

  Abstract                 = {Simulation tools play a critical role in the design and test of power systems. In particular, real time simulation is now reliable and constitutes the basis for Hardware in the Loop and Power hardware in the Loop testing techniques. The application of real time simulation and related techniques to power systems is made particularly challenging as it should cover the analysis of stochastic behaviors. In fact, numerous and volatile distributed generation (DG), and end users' dual load-generator behavior are introducing more uncertainties to the conventional power systems. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the uncertainty into the process of real time simulation as well. Methods that require many repetitions, like Monte Carlo, may not be applicable, particularly in Hardware in the Loop experiments with intrinsically long duration, e.g. those involving thermal systems. As a first step, this paper proposes to address this issue combining non-intrusive polynomial chaos theory (NIPCT) with real time simulation. The main goal is to reduce the number of test scenarios, and correspondingly the run-time. The implementation of this approach based on Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and a MATLAB toolbox (NIPC_Tool) is introduced. The method is then demonstrated on a 5-bus system and results are compared with the Monte Carlo approach.},
